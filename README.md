Hi!

Welcome to the Fall 2019 section of Creative Coding at [MICA](https://mica.edu).

You can find the current syllabus at https://github.com/abachman/creative-coding-fall-2019/blob/master/syllabus.md and a pretty, PDF version at https://github.com/abachman/creative-coding-fall-2019/blob/master/Bachman_Adam_CreativeCoding.pdf.

We meet at 4pm on Thursdays in the Dolphin design center, room 240 on the second floor.

We write code for fun and art.
