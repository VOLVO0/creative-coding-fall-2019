## Welcome to CircuitPython

[Python](https://python.org) is a programming language that runs on your computer, [CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython) is a version of Python for microcontrollers (very tiny computers).

In class we will be using [CircuitPython 4 for the CircuitPlayground Express](https://circuitpython.org/board/circuitplayground_express/) (CPX). CircuitPython is the language, CircuitPlayground is the board that uses the language. This guide will walk you through downloading and installing the latest version of CircuitPython on your CircuitPlayground board: https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython.

You can find example sketches demonstrating the use of the CircuitPlayground's **inputs** (accelerometer, temperature, light, microphone, buttons, capacitive touch pads) and **outputs** (LEDs, serial data with _print()_, speaker) [in the examples folder](./examples).

[The lib folder](./lib) has libraries you will need to copy onto your CircuitPlayground in its `lib` folder

## Alternative methods to program your CircuitPlayground

If CircuitPython isn't working well for you, you can also use [MakeCode for the CircuitPlayground](https://makecode.adafruit.com/), which is a visual programming environment built by Microsoft to make programming microcontrollers simpler. The editor generates a file you can download and install on your CircuitPlayground. The editor also includes a CircuitPlayground simulator, so you can see some of the effects of your code before you download it.
